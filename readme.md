# Experiments

This is a compilation of projects I wrote to test different features in c++. They aren't necesarily useful but somebody may find them helpful.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and `cd` into the src directory. the makefile has the default project set to helloworld. run `make project=[Project]` to compile that project. It will output to the bin directory. `make run project=[Project]` will run it.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a concept that you know and want to share, feel free to submit a pull request. If you have a concept that you don't quite understand either, create an issue.
